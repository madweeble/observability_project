# Observability Demo

## Python Microservices with FastAPI, Minikube, and Istio

## Overview
Deploys a simple FastAPI microservice on Minikube with Istio as the service mesh.
Configures observability using Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger to collect metrics, logs, and traces.

## Tech Stack
- FastAPI: Lightweight Python framework for building APIs.
- Minikube: Local Kubernetes cluster for testing.
- Istio: Service mesh for traffic control and observability.
- Prometheus: Metrics collection system.
- Grafana: Visualization tool for monitoring.
- Jaeger: Distributed tracing system.
