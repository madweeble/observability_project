# Observability Demo

## Python Microservices with FastAPI, Docker/Minikube, and Istio

## Overview
Deploys a simple FastAPI microservice on Minikube with Istio as the service mesh.
Initial setup is done using Docker to build and run services.
Configures observability using Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger to collect metrics, logs, and traces.

## Tech Stack
- FastAPI: Lightweight Python framework for building APIs.
- Docker: Docker used initially to build and test services.
- Minikube: Local Kubernetes cluster for testing.
- Istio: Service mesh for traffic control and observability.
- Prometheus: Metrics collection system.
- Grafana: Visualization tool for monitoring.
- Jaeger: Distributed tracing system.
